*Brief Bio*: I am currenly an Assistant Professor at the [https://udayton.edu/artssciences/academics/computerscience/index.php Department of Computer Science], [https://udayton.edu/ University of Dayton]. 
Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the [https://ee.nd.edu/ Department of Electrical Engineering], [https://www.nd.edu/ University of Notre Dame] (Oct 2019 - July 2020), and at the [https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/ PRECISE Center], [https://www.upenn.edu/ University of Pennsylvania] (June 2018 - Sep 2019). 
I received my B.E. in May 2012 and M.Sc. degree in December 2012 at [https://www.catholic.edu/index.html The Catholic University of America].
During my Ph.D., I was a member of the [http://www.verivital.com/ Verivital Lab] at [https://www.uta.edu/uta/ The University of Texas at Arlington], under the supervision of Prof. [http://www.taylortjohnson.com/ Taylor T. Johnson]. 
My research interest is to develop formal verification techniques and state-of-the-art software tools to enforce safety, reliability, security and resiliency of autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS), with practical applications accross CPS domains such as power and energy systems, medical devices, automotive, aerospace, and robotics.
